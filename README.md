# express-typescript

## Disclaimer
This is not a framework. It is not even a standard set up. This is just my attempt to make creating express servers for work and learning purposes easy for me.

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` ( I am assuming you already have node and npm installed)
- Create a `.env` file in your file root and use the `.env.example` template to add the values needed.
- Run `npm run dev:mac` (for Mac and Linux users) or `npm run dev:wins` (for windows users) from the root folder to start up your dev server.
